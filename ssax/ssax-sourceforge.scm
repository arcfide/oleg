   (p "This project offers tools to inter-convert between an
angular-bracket and a more efficient S-expression-based notations for
markup documents, and to manipulate and query xML data in Scheme. The
main components of the project are SSAX, SXML, SXPath, and SXSLT.")

   (p
    "A SSAX functional XML parsing framework consists of a DOM/SXML
parser, a SAX parser, and a supporting library of lexing and parsing
procedures. The procedures in the package can be used separately to
tokenize or parse various pieces of XML documents. The framework
supports XML Namespaces, character, internal and external parsed
entities, attribute value normalization, processing
instructions and CDATA sections.  The package includes a
semi-validating " (em "SXML parser") ": a DOM-mode parser that is an
instantiation of a SAX parser (called SSAX).")

   (p "" (strong "SSAX") " is a full-featured, algorithmically optimal,
pure-functional parser, which can act as a stream processor. SSAX is
an efficient SAX parser that is " (em "easy to use") ". SSAX minimizes
the amount of application-specific state that has to be shared among
user-supplied event handlers. SSAX makes the maintenance of an
application-specific element stack unnecessary, which eliminates
several classes of common bugs. SSAX is written in a pure-functional
subset of Scheme. Therefore, the event handlers are referentially
transparent, which makes them easier for a programmer to write and to
reason about.  The more expressive, reliable and easier to use
application interface for the event-driven XML parsing is the outcome
of implementing the parsing engine as an enhanced tree fold
combinator, which fully captures the control pattern of the
depth-first tree traversal.")

  (p
    "" (strong "SXML") " is an abstract syntax tree of an XML
document. SXML is also a concrete representation of the XML Infoset in
the form of S-expressions.")

  (p
    "" (strong "SXSLT") " is a manipulation language for XML and
" (strong "SXPath") " is an XPath-conforming XML query language. Both
languages internally rely on SXML as a representation of the XML Infoset.")
